## Introduction
The Thai Discourse Treebank (TDTB) is a project at NLP Lab at Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand. The annotation adopts the sense inventory from PDTB 3.0. 


## Data 
The documents are sampled from the LST20 corpus (Boonkwan et al., 2020). The text consists of news articles in various genres. In the LST20 corpus, the word segmentation, sentence segmentation, and POS tags are manually annotated as part of the original LST20 corpus. 

This corpus consists 180 documents annotated with explicit discourse relations and the accompanying two argument spans. The total number of relations is 10,868 relations.

| Split | Relations |
|-------|-----------|
| train | 8279 |
| dev | 1244 |
| test | 1345 |
| *total* | 10868 | 

The dependency parser used to generating `.conllu` files is trained on the Thai Universal Dependency (Sriwirote et al., 2025). The parser achieves 87.39 UAS and 78.09 LAS without gold-standard POS tag. The parser can be found at https://github.com/nlp-chula/attaparse
